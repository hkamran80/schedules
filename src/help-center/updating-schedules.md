Schedules must be updated by the user every time a new version is released. You can find out when a new release occurs by joining the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M586RvpCWP).

To update, the process is as follows:
1. Check that you're not running the version by clicking "About" or "Release Notes" and looking at the subheader
2. Reload the page
3. Wait for the banner at the bottom that says "An update is available for Schedules!", then click "Update"
4. Check that you're running the version by clicking "About" or "Release Notes" and looking at the subheader
5. Use the new version!

If the banner did not pop up after about ten seconds, repeat the process until you are updated.
