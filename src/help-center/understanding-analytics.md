Schedules collects anonymous analytics though the open-source analytics platform [Umami](https://umami.is/). Umami's goal is to "provide you with a friendlier, privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics." Umami was chosen because of its focus on privacy. As told on their features page, "Umami does not collect any personally identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected."

In the future, the Umami dashboard will be open to all, but right now, it is restricted to the development team only.


Data collected by Umami includes:
- Pages visited
- The referrer (where you came from)
- What time Schedules was accessed
- The browser
- The operating system
- The type of device (mobile, desktop, laptop)
- The country you are accessing Schedules from
