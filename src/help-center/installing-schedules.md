Schedules does not currently have any native apps, that is to say, apps that you can download and install through the App Store (iOS) or the Play Store (Android). However, Schedules is a PWA (Progressive Web App) ([learn more about PWAs here](https://go.unisontech.org/define-pwa)). This means that it can be installed like a native app. Here are the steps to do so.


### Android
1. Open Chrome
    - You can use any other browser, but for the best experience, use Chrome. This guide will use Chrome.
    - Installing through Chrome allows Schedules to feel more like a native app
2. Open Schedules
3. If you see the banner at the bottom that says "Add Schedules to your home screen", click that. Otherwise, tap the three vertical dots in the address bar, then tap "Install"
4. Wait for the app to finish installing
    - This may take several minutes depending on your Internet connection
    - There will also be a notification that tells you the current progress
5. Open the app, if it doesn't automatically open
    - The PWA will act like a normal app and be in your app drawer or on your home screen
6. Enjoy!


### iOS
1. Open Safari
    - You must use Safari. Safari is the only iOS browser that can install PWAs.
2. Open Schedules
3. Click the "Share" button
4. Scroll down and click "Add to Home Screen"
5. Enter a name for the app, if it is not already pre-filled, then click "Add"
6. Open the app via your home screen
7. Enjoy!


### macOS & Windows
1. Open Google Chrome
    - Chrome is the only macOS browser that supports PWAs
2. Open Schedules
3. Click the install button (either a plus button or a computer icon) next to the bookmark button in the omnibox (address bar)
    - Or you can click the three vertical dots
4. Click "Install"
5. Open the app
6. Enjoy!
