# Schedules (PWA)
## An app for all schedules, rewritten using Vue.js

### Notes
This is a work-in-progress. This is the complete rewrite of Schedules (see the `master` branch for the original code).

### Deployment
This branch is currently available at [redesign-schedules.unisontech.org](https://redesign-schedules.unisontech.org). To activate developer mode on the site to see the underlying variables displayed, add the parameter `dev` with the value of `true` to the end of the URL (example: `https://redesign-schedules.unisontech.org/schedule/ca-auhsd-hss?dev=true`).

### Development
* Setting up the project: `npm install`
* Compiles and hot-reloads for development: 
    * `npm run serve`
    * `npm run lintserve` (lints, then serves the application)
* Compiles and minifies for production: `npm run build`
* Lints and fixes files: `npm run lint`
